 Why did I buy this camera?  Travel.  I was looking for a smaller camera that would give me the range I currently have with my DSLR, (18-480mm) using a T6s w/18-135mm, 24mm, 70-300mm.  Photography is a hobby for me and so is traveling.  I have traveled around the world with my DSLR gear for years with a PowerShot G series as my backup.  My most recent was the G1x Mark II which I loved.  The G1x MII has found a new home and has been replaced with the G3x.<br /><br />The Canon G3x will now become my travel-light camera with my phone camera as a backup.  I’m not giving up the T6s for good, just when I travel.  The G3x super zoom range covers the range that I would need two lenses for with the T6s.  The zoom is quiet and fast and I love the manual dial that allows you to quickly move from 24mm to 28, 35, 50, 85, 100, 135, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600mm (and back).  If seconds count, then this dial will be an option to the electronic zoom.  The review from “WINKY” gives this camera a 1 star rating which I don’t think the G3x deserves.  I emailed Canon on the rattling noise as my G3x, out of the box, did the same thing.  The rattling noise is not a quality control issue.  Canon informed me that inside of the lens are extremely tiny little motors that control the Image Stabilization feature of the camera.  It is normal to hear rattling coming from the lens due to this.  This is completely normal and does not affect the operation of the camera.  This IS is amazing and the super zoom is quiet and fast.<br /><br />Google to get technical specifications for this camera.  There is no need duplicate that information in this review.  This camera is great for the hobbyist and the enthusiast who want more control of composing the shot that a point-n-shoot and a phone camera cannot do.<br /><br />Yes, this camera is expensive but WOW does this camera take great pictures indoors and outdoors.  Video is amazing.  I’m a hobbyist, not a professional, who documents my travel adventures.  I did not have a problem paying the price to lighten my camera gear weight when traveling.  I’ll let the photos tell the story and will post more.  They were all taken in Auto Mode with no post processing.  You really can’t tell the difference between the photo taken with the T6s @ 135mm and the G3x @ 135mm.<br /><br />Picture1:  T6s, auto @135mm<br />Picture2:  G3x, auto @135mm (Can’t tell the difference can you?)<br />Picture3:  G3x, auto @600mm (WOW)<br />Picture4:  G3x, auto @ 25x digital zoom<br />Picture5:  G3x, auto indoor, no flash, very sharp<br />Picture6:  G3x, auto, indoor, no flash, very sharp<br />Picture7:  Handheld at 600mm.<br />Picture8:  AV mode at Bowness-on-Windermere, Lake District National Park, UK<br />Picture9:  AV mode no flash at the Royal Military Tattoo, Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland<br />Picture10: TV mode, on a bus going 60mph taken through the bus window using the touch shutter.<br />Picture11:  TV mode, on a bus going 60mph taken in the rain through the bus window covered with rain.

Just added two pictures taken handheld at 600mm.  This camera is AMAZING.<br /><br />***Update***09/07/2015***<br />Just returned from a 3 week holiday in the UK and France.  I couldn't be happier with this camera.  I shoot primarily in AV and TV mode.  Only regret I have is that I wish I had taken more shots using the Auto mode.  I find that the shutter has more play in it than my DSLR but I got used to it.
 I took a while to decide on this camera. At 999 is a good bit more than a FZ1000 and not really less than a RX10-II when you factor in the external EVF (170-250USD value). I got it nevertheless and here's why:<br /><br />Pros!<br />- 24-600mm optical zoom (2400mm digital). That's sufficiently more than the FZ1000's 400mm to shot for the moon properly, for example.<br />- slightly better optics than the FZ1000. Good at 600mm, good for macro as well.<br />- slightly worse optics than the RX10-II (but again, much longer zoom range as the RX10 tops at 200mm)<br />- Light and small compared to RX10 and FZ1000<br />- Fast/easy way to transfer pictures wirelessly (better than sony/panasonic's). Remote shooting only works on iOS right now.<br />- Touchscreen. Actually works well and is useful for setting up compared to buttons.<br /><br />Cons!<br />- No built in EVF (there's an external one to buy separately)<br />- No thread on the lens (have to build an adapter separately which adds a thread)<br />- Lens hangs around when powered off, makes a bit of noise which feels like its clunky (even thus it doesn't cause any issue)<br />- touchscreen orientation does not go sideway, only up/down and flipped-upwards for &#34;selfies&#34;<br />- 1080p60 video max (competition does 4k 30fps)<br />- no real slowmo modes (rx10 does 960fps shooting)<br />- its slower to take pictures than the competition, noticeably, specially if you don't use the burst mode (burst is also slower though)<br />- focus is a tad slower than the competition, sometimes fail to focus<br />- Auto mode cannot shot raw, all other modes require setup before shooting<br /><br />In summary vs other cameras:<br />Compared to the RX10-II here's what I'm missing:<br />- F2.8 at 200mm<br />- 960fps mode<br />- EVF<br />- 4k video<br /><br />Compared to the FZ1000 here's what I'm missing:<br />- Fast focus. Fast shooting. FZ1000 rules here and that's probably what I miss the most.<br />- Simple access to advanced camera functions - albeit the touchscreen UI mitigates that a bit.<br />- EVF<br />- 4k video<br /><br />Here's why I'm using the G3X and not the two others:<br />- price online is closer to the FZ1000 than Amazon's (it'll get down there over time)<br />- image quality is slightly better than the FZ1000<br />- its light/easy to carry compared to both<br />- zoom range (one of its main advantages)<br />- with the EVF added, its okay (999USD online for EVF+G3X)<br /><br />It's a really close call with the FZ1000 for me, as fast focus/shooting is something I'm actually missing (I used to have an FZ1000 and gave it away, mind you). I suspect the FZ2000 if it ever comes out this year will take the crown to the G3X as long as it provides similar range and image quality while retaining advantages of the FZ1000.<br /><br />Should you buy it?<br />If its your only zoom camera, you don't care for video capabilities, and don't care for EVF too much (or willing to buy it additionally), whant the lightest-longest-range-trade-off camera with a good image quality, yes, the G3X is currently the best you can get, you should buy it.<br />If you answered no to any of these, you're probably better off with another camera.<br /><br />Finally: I looked also at the P900 - worse sensor, 2000mm zoom, cheaper, etc. The image quality of the G3X at 2000mm (digital zoom/cropped) is as good or better than the P900 at 2000mm (optical) in most conditions. And the G3X completely destroys the P900 at closer range.<br /><br />Side pictures info:<br /><br />- Moon at 600mm f5.6m iso 125, shutter 6&#34;, tripod night time (it also works handled but looks a little less good due to the shorter shutter time)<br />- San Francisco Ferry building (clock building) 600mm f5.6, handheld (IS on), sunset<br />- Bee, sunny, 23-35mm f2.8-3.2<br />- Dock views and San Francisco Bay Bridge at 24mm (bridge), 600mm (docks), 2400mm digital/crop (boat)<br />- Golden gate bridge at ~400mm f5.6
 I am an advanced amateur photographer. I've owned three different generations of Canon EOS DSLR cameras. My current DSLR is a Canon EOS 60D.  I shoot mostly in Raw format. I purchased my G3 X from my local camera store, so I could get some hands-on experience prior to committing to purchase it.<br /><br />I purchased the G3 X to use when traveling light, after reading many favorable reviews (I found the review in the Luminous Landscape blog to be the most relevant to my needs). I hate shooting with an LCD display, so I purchased the accessory electronic viewfinder EVF-DC1. I also got the lens hood/filter adapter combo. I love the G3 X so much I will probably be using it way more than my 60D going forward.<br /><br />I found that the Lowepro 45 AW II case is the perfect size for this camera with the EVF attached.The front pocket has room for the charger, filters, and other accessories. If you don't want an EVF, then get a smaller case.<br /><br />I won't go over all the camera's features; you can read the specs and check other reviews yourself for that. If you are familiar with other Canon cameras, you will find the G3 X extremely easy to learn to use. For me, the highlights of this camera are:<br /><br />1. Small size and weight are at the top of my list. You get images close to DSLR quality with a much smaller and lighter weight camera.<br /><br />2. The optional EVF works great (other than a slight delay for it to turn on when you lift the camera to your face). I love using it for reviewing already taken images - they appear life size!<br /><br />3. Picture quality is amazing; it is indistinguishable from my 60D. The Image Stabilization works extremely well. Image quality at higher ISO settings is fantastic. Noise at moderately high ISO settings can be nearly eliminated with the de-noise functions in Photoshop or Lightroom. Noise at the highest ISO settings is acceptable for very small pictures, or for posting on social media.<br /><br />4. The lens hood and filter adapter work well. I keep them on the camera all the time, along with a 67mm clear filter and 67mm lens cap for lens protection. You can invert the lens hood for storage, just like on many DSLR lenses. See picture below.<br /><br />5. If you are a Raw shooter, and you use Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom, the G3 X Raw format is recognized by Photoshop CS6 or CC, or Lightroom 6 or CC. The camera's Raw files have an embedded lens profile, which is automatically recognized and applied by Adobe Camera Raw. You don't have to check a box to apply a camera and lens profile like you do for older cameras.<br /><br />I do have some issues with this camera, but I didn't feel any of them were serious enough to not give it 5 star rating. If anyone from Canon reads this review, I believe their developers could fix items 4-9 in future firmware updates. Here is my nitpick list:<br /><br />1. It is hard to hold the shutter button halfway down (to check exposure or lock focus) without either letting it up, or accidentally taking a picture.<br /><br />2. The movie button hard to press. It's flush with the top of the camera, presumably to prevent unwanted triggering. I found it difficult to push in.<br /><br />3. When the camera is powered off, and rocked front to back, you can feel and hear a slight amount of motion of the components inside the lens barrel. Once the camera is turned on and the lens extends, this issue goes away.<br /><br />4. The large ring around the lens can be programmed to do many things, but zoom is not one of them. I would love to use this ring to control zoom.<br /><br />5. In Auto or &#34;P&#34; modes, you must hold the shutter halfway down (or press the &#34;*&#34; button) to see the exposure being used. I prefer the way my 60D works; it always displays the exposure with the shutter button released.<br /><br />6. Even though Raw images contain an embedded JPEG, they can't be downloaded via Wifi to an iOS or Android phone or tablet, and can not be posted to social media directly from the camera. If you want to do this, you can shoot Raw+JPEG. You can download and/or post the JPEGs, and then transfer the Raw images to your PC for serious photo editing.<br /><br />7. Remote shooting using the iOS Canon Camera Connect app works great for stills, but not for movies. There is no way (at least that I could figure out) to start and stop movie recording from the app.<br /><br />8. When images are transferred to your iOS phone or tablet using the camera's built-in WiFi, they are assigned file names by that device. The original file name as stored on the camera's memory card is not used. This makes it difficult to correlate images on your device with the originals in the camera. It would help if Canon stored the original file name somewhere in the EXIF data on the images downloaded to a device.<br /><br />9. My Menu (favorite menu items) can only be programmed with items from the shooting menu, not the setup menu. On my 60D, I have favorite menu items for Format and Screen Brightness. It's not possible to do that on the G3 X.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to any DSLR shooter looking for a small and lightweight option. I would also recommend it to those thinking about upgrading from a point-and-shoot to their first DSLR.
 Great travel camera with fabulous pictures - good purchase. Better then carrying all those lenses!
 After much deliberation I purchased a package of the Canon G3X with the EVF-DC1.  The camera is not a small camera and will not fit in a normal pocket by any means.  The lens protrudes and the weight is substantial.  But the camera comes with a lot of setting options that most users will either love and engage or hate and ignore.  Although the camera is quite pricey, I get the impression that Canon invested into a larger sensor (although I still haven't figured out how they can call this a 1&#34; sensor when it is actually quite a bit smaller), many, many options and a  lens that will zoom out to an equivalent of 600mm.  I am a part time professional photographer with two Canon DSLR late model bodies and many L lens.  I bought this camera for travel when seeing the grandkids.  I like the zoom ability although will probably will never use the lens all zoomed out.  I did some test shots at ISO1600 and was impressed that the noise was very acceptable (although my images all were well lit).  The image stabilization is quite good--I have not had a difficulty with blurred images.  Although I shoot in RAW, the jpeg images on the back display appear to me somewhat flat with low contrast and not the warm cast that other Canon cameras produce on AWB settings.  This being said, it's not a lot of work to tweak the color balance on the viewscreen. The color rendition is noticeably different than a G12 that I own--cooler and has a slight green tinge.  But if you shoot in RAW, none of this matters.  I also bought the camera because my two Canon flashes (580 EX and 600RT) will both fit and work automatically on the hotshoe. The added viewfinder (for over $200) is necessary for me and it's a disappointment at this price-point doesn't have one built in.  Probably my biggest concern is that I don't sense that the lens is as sharp as the one on the G12, an older less expensive camera.  It's not that this lens isn't sharp enough, it's just not outstanding.  I think the extra expense was spent on the sensor, zoom lens (with average sharpness), a chip with a lot of shooting options and solid camera body.  I would have preferred lens sharpness and not the incorporation to a limited in camera HDR capacity, things like ND filter, sepia, etc.  Canon tried to be all things to all people.  I just wish they would have kept things more basic but have an equivalent to a Zeiss lens on the camera.  Overall, it should make most people happy, except for the cost which is pretty steep for a prosumer camera.
 This camera is PERFECT all the way around and I HIGHLY recommend it!  Enough said...
 so far this camera is working good for me. Haven't had a lot of time to get out and take photos but I did do some fireworks and they turned out good. I replaced my 60D and lenses for this. Tired of packing all that stuff around. This is so my easier to take with you.
 Great camera to walk about with. Image quality very high.
 Great build, very comfortable in hand, good pics. Good in the sense that the quality of image lies somewhere between point and shoot and DSLR. NIce to have all that zoom with out huge lense on. Wifi very simple to use and works well when traveling. Probably bought to soon and paid to much.
 Impressed by the image quality over my trusty 12mp S120 I've been using for a year and a half. The larger sensor is making a big difference already and having more manual features in star mode is great too. Has a little trouble focusing on things closer up but with manual focusing you can usually dial it in nicely. Still learning this camera, but if your looking for a good quality camera that has a nice reach for things at a distance then buy this camera. It's well built and with the digic 6 processor the photos look really nice.
 a good quality camera, with a great reaching telephoto, of up to 600 mm.  Has limitless features half of which I will never use, but I appreciate them making this such a good quality camera, with all great features so far.  I just wish for the EV they wouldn't have charged so much ($250)///and I notice in Japan Canon charged only $16 for the EV (external viewfinder).  Now I notice a lot of the places to purchase seem to include it in the original purchase for nothing.  Irks me that I had to get stiffed by amazon.com for the $250.
 I am very happy with this product
 October 2017 - I've just bought my second one! The lens motor started to fail and the spring on the zoom button no longer worked. That sounds bad until you realize that I'd taken 19,000 photos with it. If you are in the market for a high end compact then you probably have 3 choices, the G3x, the Panasonic FZ2500, and Sony RX100-III. The G3X has more zoom (25x vs 20x or 16x) and a touch screen, but if those aren't important to you then check out the others. For me the zoom matters, and canon did such a nice job with the touch screen that I'd have trouble going back to all of those knobs and buttons. The fact that I'm buying the same again is probably all you need to know, but you can check out my original review below.<br /><br />This is an outstanding all round camera. As well as first impressions I've added updates below after a few hundred pics and a couple of thousand pics - the more I use this camera the more I like it.<br /><br />Can I replace both of my current cameras with the G3X? Yes!<br />For indoors and shooting sports in low light (like basketball in a poorly lit gym) I currently have a Canon G15 (fast lens but zoom is limited to 5x), and for outdoors a Canon SX50 HS (50x zoom).<br /><br />Under all but the most extreme conditions it outperforms both of them. If you really need to zoom out beyond 30x then the SX50 is a little better, and if you need to shoot sports in really low light and a zoom of 5x is enough then the G15 is a little better.<br /><br />So what's to like or dislike?<br />Dislikes:  Ergonomically it has some shortcomings for me - you can change your highest priority setting (like aperture, speed, iso) using the front dial and I don't find this placed as conveniently (on top of the camera) as it was on the G15. I always want to be able to shoot one handed and the right hand grip isn't quite shaped for that, although it's a fairly simple matter to build it up a bit. I also find it heavy for a compact camera, much heavier than any I've had before. One problem with the touch screen (which I mostly like) is that it is too easy to change settings by mistake with your thumb.<br /><br />A major gripe: I always use a protective UV filter and a folding rubber lens hood, so it is really annoying that Canon insists that you can only buy their (plastic) lens adapter together with their (plastic) lens hood for around $40. The good news is that I tried the sturdy metal lens adaptor off my SX50 and it fits.<br /><br />Likes:  Some reviewers don't like the absence of a digital view finder. That's very much personal choice and I never use a dvf so for me it's a plus. Some have found it slow to focus, I've no complaints on that score. I do like the tilt touch screen - specially for the auto-focus (you touch on the thing you want to focus on and it locks onto it as you pan the camera). I'd prefer both tilt and swivel though. I like the Canon menu system and they've done a good job of not changing too much at a time as they move from one generation of camera to the next.<br /><br />Update added after owning the camera for several weeks. This camera is way better than I thought at first. I've got several hundred pics and can compare them and I've have had a chance to try different camera settings in real situations. For low light situations you can ramp the speed up to 3200 ISO and still get pretty good pics (they'll print at up to 4&#34; x 6&#34; without being too grainy). The colour balance in low light is also better than I expected.<br /><br />Second update a couple of weeks later and after a couple of thousand pics. Wow. The more I use this camera the more it grows on me. I've still only used 'Auto', 'Sport', and 'Tv (exposure time priority)' settings, but now that I'm more familiar with it I'm finding the combination of touch screen and dial settings to be very nicely designed. I'm also finding that the performance under real world conditions exceeds what I expected. A couple of days ago I was shooting wrestling in a fairly typically lit high school gym and found that from the top of the bleachers I could zoom in to anywhere on the floor and get good pics with exposure times of 1/125 or less. I didn't think you could get that kind of performance with a compact. (But I still don't find the front dial as conveniently placed as it was on the G15).<br /><br />Third update. After close to 5000 photos. Track season is here and I had previously used my 50x (1200mm equivalent) Canon SX50. Some reviewers have complained about the time to focus. Would the G3X be up to the job? You're at the wrong end of the track and you realize one of your kids has started her run-up to the pole vault. Can you pan-zoom-focus in time to get a good shot of her clearing (you hope!) the bar? YES. Your kid is running the 100m, is the zoom up to the job of getting crisp shots of him coming out of the starting blocks from the far end of the track? YES. Also: this camera has a pretty fast lens for the zoom range so in sport mode even long shots default to 1/1000 or faster under light cloud. Continuous shooting speed up to around 6 shots per second which is great for action shots. Even under bright sunlight I've found the LCD screen just fine - and you can always tilt it to minimize glare. Note that for outdoor sports photography I always use a monopod (the Slik Lighty Pod is a good one) so I can't comment on hand-held performance, but first time out I got the best sports pics ever.<br /><br />By the way, most cameras are designed to be held by 'everyone' so the grips are less than ideal for most people. I recommend building the shape up with double sided sticky mounting foam and then put sticky backed felt (available from JoAnn or other craft shops) over the top.  If you do this with the G3X you'll find that you can pretty much do everything with one hand - grip, point adjust settings, shoot.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifications (zooms are in 35mm equivalent)<br />G15: zoom 28mm -140mm at f1.8 -  f2.8 max, 12Mp, iso 80-12800 (80 - 2000 is realistic)<br />SX50 HS: zoom 24mm - 1200 at f3.4 - f6.5 max, 12Mp, iso 80-6400 (80 -1600 is realistic)<br />G3X: zoom 24mm - 600 at f2.8 - f5.6 max, 20Mp, iso 125 - 12800 (124 - 3200 is realistic)
 Amazing camera.  Let these photos of my Christmas Vacation in Costa Rica speak for themselves.  They were shot JPEG with no post processing, P mode.  I am an amateur photographer.  Tiger photo shot at LA Zoo.
 Very convenient
 I have been using the G3X only for bird photography and shooting RAW. After processing with LR and NIK, the files even at higher ISO is very acceptable for a birding enthusiast. Unfortunately due to slower focus and failure to focus, I use manual focus almost exclusively. Another annoying problem is changing from manual focus to controlling ISO and Aperture using the front focus dial but I believe this can be corrected in the menus. If Canon ever releases an EF-M lens with similar range for the M3, then I would sell the G3X. But until that happens, it is a plus being able to use the EVF for both. For bird photography, I could not go without the EVF. And configured correctly, it makes a good alternative to a DSLR with similar focal range.
 This will be a layman's review of Canon G3x. I had the camera for 48 hours, shot quite a few photos under various conditions and thus, this quick review. First of all, if you owned a Canon G16 or G15, you are in luck since this camera also uses the same battery. Battery life is around 275-320 photos and videos.  The menu system of this camera is pretty familiar to anyone who have owned previous Canon camera. The instruction book is pretty simple and easy to follow. I haven't messed with the wifi stuff at all but ironically speaking, I don't mess with it. I guess you have to read else where for that.<br /><br />The camera shoot fantastically well when you are outside and in the daylight. It flawless per say. The zoom motor is fast...that lens sticks out there fast and furious. Autofocus is quick, images are fantastic. It also shoot RAW but you have to convert them yourself. This camera don't have an in-house RAW conversion within the camera. For a  pricey camera, that was bit of a let down. It take great videos of course. Simply put, outside you can't go wrong with this camera. First rate all the way. Inside, you may have some problem. It still a good camera and if you keep the aperture large enough, it will take great photos inside. But if you are zooming at max range of 600mm at 5.6......you may not get the result you want. It still better then earlier ultrazoom cameras but I think my Panasonic FZ200 with 2.8 constant with a smaller sensor, can still do better at longer zoom. So in the darker places of the world...I recommended you don't zoom much.<br /><br />The camera is built like a tank. I can see why Canon states that it can with stand the dust and rain. There is good solid feel to the camera. It feel very comfortable to your hand (unless you got huge hands) and there is a good &#34;heft&#34; to the camera that is comfortable. There is that nice metal feeling to the feel of the camera. The size of Canon G3x is about the same as my Panasonic FZ200 camera and slighter wider then my Panasonic GX1 camera. The body appears small so the lens really look big.<br /><br />The image stabilizer worked pretty well. Here you may hear some &#34;clunking&#34; noises which I read else where that it is the image stabilizers moving around a bit, being too close to the lens so I read. It claims to be harmless but I do admit, I get little nervous hearing that noise. The camera come with no EVF but I did get the Canon's portable EVF and it works wonderfully well. I'll be using that a lot with this camera. With any big zoom cameras, you will need an EVF, people may ponder why Canon did not have one on a thousand dollar camera, eh? But I also read that portable<br />EVF may shorten battery life in the camera. I haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />The layout of the camera is rather simplistic and easy. Initially I was surprise by the limited choices you had on assigning function to the shortcut buttons. But I realized that the LCD is also a touchscreen and many of the short cuts are there on the screen by just touching them. Good example would be the flash mode that become functional once you pop the flash, for a first several seconds, you can adjust the flash compensation turning the dial on the top of the camera. You have to hit the flash mode on the back dial to do this....more then once since flash compensation mode disappeared after a few seconds. Then the top dial revert back to the original function you selected earlier when you were setting up the camera. The hype on the G3x didn't mentioned touchscreen that heavily so it kind of slip my mind. The instruction booklet that come with the camera don't even talk about it. (No doubt, this touchscreen is probably the reason why this camera is so expensive!!!)<br /><br />I got my camera from the local photo store, Amazon haven't even began shipping so I cancelled my Amazon order, the price was the same and I needed the camera by next Tuesday. So far, the camera have performed very well but its not wholly a perfect camera. I am concern how good an indoor long zoom result will be when tested at conventions, where a 600mm is a great reach but 5.6 aperture may compromise the image. And that image stabilizer clunking noise bother me as well. But otherwise, this is a great photo taking camera and images will impressed you.
 Casual users may not get the most from this camera.  For myself, 600mm is really unstable for handheld photography, and the 'slow' lens resulted in many blurry pictures.  I was also disappointed at how long it takes to save each image, making the experience feel very tedious.<br /><br />On the positive, the camera is constructed very nicely, and it was easy to maintain focus under 400mm or so.
 I mainly bought this camera due to travelling to parts of Europe and wanted to ensure I could snap some seriously high quality shots to take back and edit for friends and family.<br /><br />The Camera itself coupled excellent image quality along with a long zoom range, but it really needs a built-in EVF if it was to meet all my demands on the trip and shooting on the fly. I also took with me this Sony here: http://amzn.to/1OXMbxc which also performed beyond my expectations and I will update this review with some images once I've got them uploaded.<br /><br />Pros so far:<br />Long zoom range. 1-inch image sensor. Tilting touch-screen display. Framing assist function. Hot shoe supports add-on EVF and Canon Speedlites. Mic and headphone connections. Built-in ND filter. Sealed against dust and moisture. Wi-Fi.<br /><br />Cons so far:<br />Focus on the sluggish side. Slow burst rate when shooting Raw. Takes a while to turn on. EVF is a pricey accessory.
 I am a Canon person.  I love this camera.  It's not as good as having a 5D Mark II or Mark III with a 600mm lens, but for so many situations it's fine and way more affordable --  it's pretty darned good if you don't want to lug those around (or buy/rent the lenses).  The touch screen and the external controls are similar to other Canons, which makes it easier to use, and where the functions aren't to one's liking they can be reassigned.  I do not like that there is no optical viewfinder.  While the electronic viewfinder can be bought as an extra and is better at framing the actual shot than the optical viewfinder on other Powershot cameras, I'm still trying to assess whether it's that much of a help in bright light versus just moving the screen to a different angle see better.<br /><br />Manual focus is easier to use than previous generation Powershot cameras.  This camera does well with sunsets, happily, compared to other small cameras I've used.  It is slow focusing, and if you shoot in RAW, I strongly recommend getting faster SD cards if possible.<br /><br />If you want to use a UV filter or any other filter, it needs a filter adaptor and a bigger lens cap, which I didn't realize from the product description.  Minor detail, though. This camera has that Powershot feature where you can take the photo and the camera also makes a few second digest video that it stitches together
 What a great little camera and a really nice zoom.  Very good image quality for a 1&#34; sensor.  I almost kept this but needed something with a larger sensor and that was more video centric. Loved that it had a mic port but wish the screen tilted out and too the side instead of tilted up where the Mic would be.  My favorite Powershot model by far.  Wish I had the budget to have a camera quiver because if I did this would be in it.
 I love love LOVE this camera. Did I mention that I LOVE this camera??? I usually shoot Nikon, and had bought a Sony A6000 for my birthday, but I was annoyed by the inadequate lens range of the Sony. I go shooting with a group and the leaders both have this camera. I traded in my Sony for this one. I LOVE this camera. It is not too heavy, has amazing lens range and I am learning how to do soooo much with it. I even figured out how to do some long exposure shots that came out fabulously. This is my new go to daily camera. I cannot wait for my next vacation - I will only need to pack this camera and its filters & viewfinder, making my purse that much lighter :)
 I have Canons from the 7, 5, and 1 series along with more lenses than I can keep up with.  So, I am very familiar with the Canon operating system. The autofocus on my G3X is horrible. Beyond bad on anything except the very most stationary of objects. Perhaps I just got the bad one; in either case, I am returning the Canon G3X.
 I like many things about my G3x + evf bundle: the image quality, the focal range, the mic and headphone jacks, the flip-screen. That said, there is a problem with the LCD screen that I suspect is not unique to my unit: In reviewing a just-taken photo, the monitor (and image) has a slight green tint to it, leading one to believe that the color balance is off. However, once the image is sent to a computer, tv monitor, etc, the image is fine, without the added green hue. Further, the image and color balance are also fine when viewed through the evf, so it's obvious that the problem is in the LCD screen, not in the processing software or image itself. So the images that the g3x produces are impressive, even if at first glance, the screen doesn't always render them faithfully. I'm hoping that Canon can fix this with a firmware update.
 I thoroughly enjoy taking pictures and using this camera and I am very happy with its results. The quality of the images and the camera functionality is amazing. This camera is not a good choice for casual users due to its advanced features and functionality. The only functionality complaint I have is the placement of the flash activation switch which is impeded by the camera strap. Otherwise, extremely impressed with the camera.<br /><br />Although, I am not impressed with its durability. I originally purchased the camera in Nov 2015. I used it a lot in home and outside the home. I hike a lot in the Las Vegas, NV region and thus take thousands of pictures of my experiences in the back country of the region. The camera worked great until May 2016 when I accidentally knocked it off a table dropping it 2.5 to 3 feet while in a cushioned case. Afterwards, the camera stopped working. My bad so I accept responsibility for that accident. I thus sent it in to Canon repair. The back cover was bent and sand was in the focusing ring. I paid the $270 fee resulting in a new camera being mailed to me since they don't fix the problem, but instead simply send you a new camera. Within a month, the camera started to malfunction. The focusing frame would appear green like it should when pressing the shutter halfway, but the camera would intermittently not take a photo when the shutter was fully pressed. Instead, the screen would freeze and the mechanism inside the camera would continually whine sometimes for a few seconds (draining the battery) and then take the picture or the screen would go blank displaying a lens error requiring me to remove the battery to reset the camera. At first the issue was a minor nuisance until it got progressively worse during a long vacation visiting and hiking National Parks in the region. Upon returning, I submitted the camera for repair figuring it was a warranty problem. The resulting evaluation instead indicated there was sand in the lens and thus not a warranty problem. Again, I paid the $270 fee resulting in a new camera. The camera works great and I am very happy to be able to use it again. Although, I am very concerned with its durability and prevention of sand entering the mechanism during normal use outdoors. My previous camera was an Olympus 590UZ (an advanced point and shoot) I bought in 2009. After 6 years, I beat the hell out of that camera due to extensive use in harsh environments until time for a new camera. After extensive research, I concluded the G3 X was the best choice. My 590UZ even kept working even after dropping it a few feet and falling out of my case while rappelling and it even got partially submerged when I slipped and fell into a shallow pool while in its case. I also have a Canon 100D SLR for which I recently slipped on a slope for which that camera fell out of the case (I mistakenly didn't secure the latch) causing it to slide on the slope and dirt for a few feet. I simply brushed it off and it works great without issues.<br /><br />Simply be careful with the G3 X outdoors. Brush off and wipe the camera using a soft cloth and lens blower brush often including the protruding lens after use to prevent issues I have experienced.<br /><br />The durability and sand issue is the only reason I give this camera 4 stars. Otherwise, it is an absolutely amazing camera 5 star camera. You will greatly enjoy using this camera!
 This is my go to travel camera. I've taken 50+ photos in a day and the battery lasted. The form factor is great. The prosumer and adventure hobbyist will thoroughly enjoy this piece of kit. I am a amateur photographer who likes to experiment with techniques.  You can do just that with this more compact form factor.
 Loved the camera..quality build, great pictures, just didn't want to deal with detachable evf... stuck up too high and worried about breaking it off in bag and didn't want to take it on and off. Returned it. Maybe they'll come out with one with attached evf.
 I own the G7x and was curious to find out if the lens on the G3x would be an obvious upgrade in clarity.<br />Its not.<br />So, here is the scoop.<br />This camera is larger then, the Canon EOS, and its HEAVEY.<br />ITs a brick.<br />The online  reviews tend to sheepishly say this camera is a P&S with a large lens, but the reality is, the camera is large, the lens is large and it is definitely NOT a P&S situation.<br />Its a brick.<br />Wide angle, wide open, is good but marginally soft.<br />Macro at Wide angle is 50-50% focus and not nearly as sharp in macro as the G9x wide open.<br />The Zoom is quick and sharp, and is the selling feature.<br />The focus lock as compared to the G9x is slightly slower and there is a bit of lag before the camera clears for next photo in AF.<br />I also owned the Canon EOS M-10, and it's photos are slightly softer then the G3X's photos, but the EOS-M10 handles a lot better and you have the option of different lenses.
 This camera is phenominal.  Used it to photograph an event.  it is fast, fast, fast!  The lens is excellent.  Can't say enough good things about the G3X.
 This is the best yet and I bayed my Sony 100 DX3 to get it. The zoom is awesome. I have a DSLR set up with L lenses but when I want to travel light this is perfect. For outdoor work the electronic viewfinder is a must. It is too hard to see screen. However, before I got it I just shot on auto anyway and most were ok...some were of nothing much as I couldn't see the screen in the bright sun.
 Love the quality of the picture with this camera
 It's a great camera, has a lot going for it and the great price on Amazon didn't hurt anything!
 Great camera, fast shipping, nice packaging. Just like it was described.
